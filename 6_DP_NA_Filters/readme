# Aim : 
#------#
Filters gVCF for DP range and genotype frequencies on VCF called with either haploid or diploid gVCF
See the HTML file to see the example on rat's dataset on the Y heploid chromosome

# Input :
#----------#
gVCF (generated with GATK)
Function in the folder "R_functions_ploidy1" or "R_function" are needed

# Methods :
#----------#
- Describe DP distribution and genotype frequencies on VCF
- Filters by using the R functions

The scripts are as follow :

To see the results expected on real dataset : .rmd and .html are the pipeline run on the rat VCF on Ychromosome
To run the pipeline  : .r script

# output :
#----------#
VCF filtered for the require DP and genotype frequencies threshold in the "data" folder
