# Aim : 
#------#
Trim illumina sequences

# Input :
#----------#

R1 and R2 fastq.gz files
Adapter file : a file with adapter sequence in fasta format 
  Adapter.fasta is a fasta file containing the adapters sequences. These seq depend on the sequencing technology. 
  For Illumina-PE look at the fasta file proposed by the software trimmomatic itself. Or re-create a fasta file with the seq you want. 
  Look in the FASTQC results can be usefull to detect the type of adapters you have in your fastq

# Methods :
#----------#
Trimmomatic 
Parameters are standard for paried-end illumina sequence : ILLUMINACLIP:${Adapter}:2:30:10 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:100 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3
Adatped for Genotoul cluster with SLURM command

# output :
#----------#
4 fastq.gz files (paired_R1/R2 ; unpaired_R1/R2) + one report for each samples trimmed
