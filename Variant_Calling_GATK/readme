# Aim : 
#------#
Run variant calling with GATK on list of samples

# Input (see details format in the sh script) :
#-----------------------------------------------#
list of sample
BAM files obtained from mapping step
Intervall_list : file with chromosome (or loci, or scaffold..) names
Reference genome path

# Methods :
#----------#
1. haplotypecaller_gatk.sh
Run the calling for each sample provided in the list. The loop launch a job on the cluster for each samples.

2. VC_allgenome or VC_loop_chromosome : Choose to run script either by chromosome (usefull on large genome) or on the complete genome at once
	Look at the readme in each folder to see how to run the pipeline

# output :
#----------#

A folder is created for each samples "samplesX_step1_variantcalling" 
A "${name}_gatk.vcf.gz" is created in each folder
